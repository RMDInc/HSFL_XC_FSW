- Version 1.0 This is a pseudo-fork of the LunaH-Map XC FSW repository. All of the code from that project has been forked here, but some of the ancillary files are not. In addition, a few files have been included (Telemetry dictionary, ICD, LunaH-Map readme, etc) which should serve to give more information about usage and the format of input and output. The purpose of this repository is to collaborate with the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory. The code base will consist largely of the same design, but will progressively diverge as the project develops and differing needs are identified. These will be reflected in separate documents for the project, including an ICD, Telemetry Dictionary, release notes, etc. which should be developed and written to support the project. At the time of writing, the LunaH-Map code is on Version 5.42 and the ICD is Version 9.5.0. Contact Graham Stoddard for access to this repository.
